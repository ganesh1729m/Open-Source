# Open Source – ML Projects & Research Collaboration  

Welcome to **Open Source**, my machine learning research repository! 🚀 Here, I share my latest projects, experiments, and findings in ML, particularly focusing on **Denoising Diffusion Models**, reinforcement learning, and deep learning applications.  

## 🔍 Current Focus  
I am currently exploring **Denoising Diffusion Models** and trying to understand unexpected outputs. If you have insights or suggestions, I’d love your input!  

## 📌 Projects in This Repository  
- **Denoising Diffusion Models** – Investigating model behavior and unexpected results.  
- **Reinforcement Learning** – Experiments with policy gradients, DQN, and other techniques.  
- **CNNs from Scratch** – Building deep learning models with custom implementations.  
- **Brain Tumor Segmentation** – Semantic segmentation of gliomas using BRATS dataset.  

## 🤝 How to Contribute  
- Check out the projects and share your thoughts in Issues or Discussions.  
- Feel free to fork and experiment with the models.  
- PRs for improvements, bug fixes, or new ideas are welcome!
